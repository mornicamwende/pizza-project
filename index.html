                            welcome to Portamor pizza inn were we're more than the slices.  Portamor was brought to existance by the great chef Madam Rose. The awesome chef used make her own recipes  and she  once made one of our own delicious recipe <strong>the Hawanii</strong>,,one of our restaurant's signature dish. 
                            our recipes have evolved and developed over the years. our pizzas are hand prepared  with the freshest ingredients Heartland. From 1960-1990, taste buds across the southeastern and southwestern U.S. were able to experience first-hand the made-from-scratch crispy, crackery Original Thin crust, and tangy signature sauce that are still hallmarks of the Pizza Inn brand today. For more than 60 years, Pizza Inn has prided ourselves on freshness and innovation, introducing the Taco Pizza in 1979, the first dessert “Pizzert” pizza in 1986 and the chain’s hallmark Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza by the 1990s. We’re still cooking up fresh ideas to this day and are committed to bringing our best pizza to the table, every time.
